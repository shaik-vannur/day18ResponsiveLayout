      Each of the different military services is assigned a role and domain. The
      Army conducts land operations. The Navy and Marine Corps conduct maritime
      operations, the Marine Corps specializing in amphibious and maritime
      littoral operations primarily for supporting the Navy. The Air Force
      conducts air operations. The Space Force conducts space operations. The
      Coast Guard is unique in that it specializes in maritime operations and is
      also a law enforcement agency.[16][17] From their inception during the
      American Revolutionary War, the U.S. Armed Forces have played a decisive
      role in the country's history. They helped forge a sense of national unity
      and identity through victories in the early-19th-century First and Second
      Barbary Wars. They played a critical role in the territorial evolution of
      the U.S., including the American Civil War. The National Security Act of
      1947 created the modern U.S. military framework, establishing the National
      Military Establishment (later the Department of Defense or DoD) headed by
      the secretary of defense and creating both the U.S. Air Force and National
      Security Council; in 1949, an amendment to the act merged the
      cabinet-level departments of the Army, Navy, and Air Force into the
      DoD.[18]

      The Russian Armed Forces are the world's fifth largest military, with 1.32
      million active-duty personnel as of 2024. Russia's military is also known
      for its nuclear weapons stockpile, ballistic missile submarines, and
      strategic bombers. However, the Russian military has faced challenges in
      combat performance and has been criticized for corruption.In spite of
      Russia's perceived military strength, as recorded in various assessments,
      deficiencies have been noted in the country's combat performance on both
      the tactical and operational scales. According to multiple reports,
      endemic corruption within the Russian Armed Forces has had a major impact
      on Russia's ability to effectively project hard power.[19][20][21] Amidst
      the Russian invasion of Ukraine, severe logistical failures have greatly
      impacted the operational performance of Russian troops, as different
      service branches have struggled to coordinate and work together.
      Continuous shortcomings have led Russia's war effort to suffer extensive
      setbacks since the initial invasion; the Russian Armed Forces have
      experienced successive losses of occupied/annexed territory, the
      large-scale destruction and squandering of their equipment, and a notably
      high casualty rate.[22][23][24] Researchers from the U.S.-funded RAND
      Corporation have observed that Russia continues to struggle with military
      professionalization.[25]

      The PLA can trace its origins during the Republican Era to the left-wing
      units of the National Revolutionary Army (NRA) of the Kuomintang (KMT)
      when they broke away in 1927 in an uprising against the nationalist
      government as the Chinese Red Army, before being reintegrated into the NRA
      as units of New Fourth Army and Eighth Route Army during the Second
      Sino-Japanese War. The two NRA communist units were reconstituted as the
      PLA in 1947.[9] Since 1949, the PLA has used nine different military
      strategies, which it calls "strategic guidelines". The most important came
      in 1956, 1980, and 1993.[10] Politically, the PLA and the paramilitary
      People's Armed Police (PAP) have the largest delegation in the National
      People's Congress (NPC); the joint delegation currently has 281
      deputies—over 9% of the total—all of whom are CCP members. The PLA is not
      a traditional nation-state military. It is a part, and the armed wing, of
      the CCP and controlled by the party, not by the state. The PLA's primary
      mission is the defense of the party and its interests. The PLA is the
      guarantor of the party's survival and rule, and the party prioritizes
      maintaining control and the loyalty of the PLA. According to Chinese law,
      the party has leadership over the armed forces and the CMC exercises
      supreme military command; the party and state CMCs are practically a
      single body by membership. Since 1989, the CCP general secretary has also
      held been the CMC Chairman; this grants significant political power as the
      only member of the Politburo Standing Committee with direct
      responsibilities for the armed forces. The Ministry of National Defense
      has no command authority; it is the PLA's interface with state and foreign
      entities and insulates the PLA from external influence.

      The Indian Armed Forces are the military forces of the Republic of India.
      It consists of three professional uniformed services: the Indian Army,
      Indian Navy, and Indian Air Force.[11] Additionally, the Indian Armed
      Forces are supported by the Central Armed Police Forces,[12] Indian Coast
      Guard and Special Frontier Force and various inter-service commands and
      institutions such as the Strategic Forces Command, the Andaman and Nicobar
      Command and the Integrated Defence Staff. The President of India is the
      Supreme Commander of the Indian Armed Forces but the executive authority
      and responsibility for national security is vested in the Prime Minister
      of India and their chosen Cabinet Ministers.[13][14][15][16] The Indian
      Armed Forces are under the management of the Ministry of Defence of the
      Government of India. With strength of over 1.4 million active
      personnel,[17][18] it is the world's second-largest military force and has
      the world's largest volunteer army.[19] It also has the third-largest
      defence budget in the world.[20] The Global Firepower Index report lists
      it as the fourth most-powerful military.[21] The Indian Armed Forces have
      been engaged in a number of major military operations, including: the
      Indo-Pakistani wars of 1947, 1965 and 1971, the Portuguese-Indian War, the
      Sino-Indian War, the 1967 Cho La incident, the 1987 Sino-Indian skirmish,
      the Kargil War, and the Siachen conflict among others. India honours its
      armed forces and military personnel annually on Armed Forces Flag Day, 7
      December. Armed with the nuclear triad,[22] the Indian armed forces are
      steadily undergoing modernisation,[23] with investments in areas such as
      futuristic soldier systems and missile defence systems.[24][23] The
      Department of Defence Production of the Ministry of Defence is responsible
      for the indigenous production of equipment used by the Indian Armed
      Forces. It comprises 16 Defence PSUs.[25] India remains one of the largest
      importer of defence equipment with Russia, Israel, France and the United
      States being the top foreign suppliers of military equipment.[26] The
      Government of India, as part of the Make in India initiative, seeks to
      indigenise manufacturing and reduce dependence on imports for defence.[27]
